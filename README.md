# Cab-Price-Prediction

Context
Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. So what exactly drives this demand? The first guess would be the time of the day; times around 9 am and 5 pm should see the highest surges on account of people commuting to work/home. Another guess would be the weather; rain/snow should cause more people to take rides.
NOTE: The date is for simulated rides with real prices i.e. how much would the ride cost IF someone actually took it. Uber/Lyft DO NOT make this data public and nor is the case in this dataset


Content
